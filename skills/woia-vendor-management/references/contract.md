Vendor qualification/quote/selection/performance references shared Identity. Original quote/performance evidence is immutable. Selection/preference never authorizes contracts/payment/work acceptance. External vendor contact must use Customer Service/Communications; this provider sends nothing.

## Execution

The portable scripts/provider.mjs exports initial(organization), actions and execute(state, request). It computes a new serializable state without mutating the input. Authenticated host must provide current exact authority, policy revision, resource list, source-authorized fields and scoped evidence. Request assertions are not authentication: untrusted callers must never mint the authority object. A qualified host must read authoritative policy/identity, persist state+history+operation receipt atomically with compare-and-swap on revision, fence concurrent writers and retry CAS conflicts by recomputing from current state. In-memory return is not durable acceptance. No storage service, credentials, policy values or external adapter is selected/qualified here.

Operation IDs bind action/target/payload/evidence; exact replay returns the original result, changed replay fails. Organization/authority are revalidated even for replay. Historical accepted state remains externally representable; no prompt/chat master. Protected owner approval is bound to payload digest and current policy revision with a distinct principal. Clock validity and revocations must be resolved by the trusted host before marking authority current.

## Actions

- vendor.search
- vendor.read
- vendor.qualify
- vendor.quote.record
- vendor.quote.compare
- vendor.selection.record
- vendor.performance.record

## Support

Deterministic local provider-domain behavior is implemented. Physical backend persistence, atomic multiworker storage and authenticated host integration are NOT_QUALIFIED; external effects are unsupported. Tests use synthetic state and do not establish Operator E2E or Production Ready.
